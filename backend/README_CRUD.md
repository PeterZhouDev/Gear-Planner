# Supabase Backend CRUD Setup

This folder contains SQL and documentation for setting up your Supabase backend tables and policies.

## How to Use

1. Open the Supabase dashboard for your project.
2. Go to the SQL Editor.
3. Copy the contents of `gear_items.sql` and run it to create the `gear_items` table and its RLS policy.
4. Repeat for other entities (gear_lists, journals, etc.) as needed.

## Example Svelte CRUD

See the main README or frontend code for Svelte CRUD usage examples with the Supabase JS client.
